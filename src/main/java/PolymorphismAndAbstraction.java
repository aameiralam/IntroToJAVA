public class Day8 {


//    Polymorphism - many forms
//    Compile  time polymorphism - method overloading
//    Runtime Polymorphism       - method overriding
//    Compile time - showing error while compiling
//    Run time - after running it will know

//    Method Overloading (find example and do it)
//    Method name has to be same and should occur in the same class.
//    Different number of parameters with same data type
//    Different data types with same number of parameters

//    Method Overriding
//    Method Name - Same
//    Method Overriding will be used when there are two classes having inheritance relationship and both are having same
//    method with different implementation
//      @override


//    Abstraction

//    Abstraction is the process of hiding the certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
//    Hiding the implementation
//    Using "private" keyword in methods you want to hide. For loan application, the user only needs to know the calculate
//    rate method and not the other methods like credit score, income, expenses calculation.


//    CREATE 2 TYPES OF INHERITANCE EXAMPLE
//    CREATE 2 POLYMORPHISM - MO
//    CREATE 2 POLYMORPHISM - OVERRIDING
//    1 ABSTRACTION METHOD USING PRIVATE


//    Using Abstract classes

//    We will use a keyword "abstract" along with that. Abstract methods can only be created inside an abstract class.
//    No objects can be created in this class
//    Can have both regular methods and abstract methods.
//    tip - look for the parent class that is abstract.
//    Whatever class that is extending from abstract class needs to provide the implementation.


//    Abstract Method - Abstract methods will have "abstract" keyword and will not have a body.


//    Using interfaces

//    This is another way to achieve abstraction. An interface is a complete abstract class, meaning only abstract
//    methods are allowed. To access the interface methods, interface must be implemented by another class.
//    We will use keyword "implements".

//    Rules -
//    Interfaces cannot be used to create objects.
//    Interfaces can only have abstract methods.
//    In interface by default all the methods are public.
//    In interface, we cannot contain a constructor.
//    In interface, attributes are public, static and final.
